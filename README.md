# openvpn-http

The main goal is to automatically start an openvpn server, generate certificates and clients through http requests.
The steps on certificates generation and server setup are based on this Digital Ocean tutorial https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-18-04 

TLS authentication will be skipped for now as my end goal does not need it

# project structure

Following the steps on the Digital Ocean tutorial, there will be two services, one responsible for only generating the certificates files, cert-server, and other responsible for the openvpn server, ovpn-server.

Files storage:

- When a file is generated by the easyrsa script it remains on its original place in the pki folder (/usr/share/certs/pki);
- When a .req file goes from the ovpn-server to the cert-server it is saved on /usr/share/certs/pki/reqs;
- When ca.crt is transfered from the cert-server to the ovpn-server it goes to the openvpn folder (/etc/openvpn/);
- When any other .crt file is transfered from cert-server to the ovpn-server it goes to /usr/share/certs/crt
- When .ovpn is created on the ovpn-server it is saved on /usr/share/certs/ovpn

Inside the api folder are all scripts necessary for the service.

The project structure is based on the Michael Herman course Test-Driven Development with Python, Flask, and Docker. Here is his repo https://github.com/testdrivenio/testdriven-app-2.5

# starting the services

First be sure to have docker and docker-compose installed, that is the only thing you need.

To start just run docker-compose as follows:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

After the services are running you got to initiate the pki folders on both services and the folders to store .ovpn and .crt files on the ovpn-server service.

```
docker-compose exec ovpn-server python manage.py start # initiate the pki folder and the folders to store .ovpn and .crt files
													   # /usr/share/certs/pki /usr/share/certs/ovpn /usr/share/certs/crt are 
													   # the folders created
```

```
docker-compose exec cert-server easyrsa init-pki # creates the pki folder on /usr/share/certs/pki
```

After that you are able to run the tests and call the endpoints

To stop the services run:

```
docker-compose down
```

So far this will start two services with a couple of endpoints, the ovpn server is not running yet.

# testing

To run the tests just run the scrip test.sh

```
./test.sh
```

# known issues

Sometimes, when starting the services, you may run into some permissions issues on the cert_server/certs/pki and/or ovpn_server/certs/pki folders. To run docker-compose properly change the owner of the folders and all inner files. Do not run the docker-compose with sudo

```
sudo chown -R your_user:your_user ./services/ovpn_server/certs/ 
sudo chown -R your_user:your_user ./services/cert_server/certs/ 
```
# contribute

Create a PR for an existing issue, each commit is tested on travis-ci before merge. 

Add unit tests and/or integration tests for each new method/endpoint created.

Along with the commit add the test coverage resume for the service you modified. To get the test coverage just run

```
docker-compose exec ovpn-server python manage.py cov # for the ovnp-server service
docker-compose exec cert-server python manage.py cov # for the cert-server service
```

# server configuration

To configure the ovpn server change the server.conf file on services/ovpn-server folder with the settings you need
Remember to update the base.conf file to match the alterations, that file will be used to create your client .ovpn file to connect to your server
